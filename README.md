# opencv_arm32v7_alpine

## Description
Minimalistic Image for Python 3.8 including Opencv 4.0 and Numpy on Arm32v7 Architecture.

## Note:
This image is patchwork from many other great Dockerfile writers. I just did trail and error and came up with this working example. The overall size is ~250mb.
